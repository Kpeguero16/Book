# Book

I started learning Java earlier this month as part of the curriculum for AP Computer Science A in West Broward High.

One of my resolutions for this year is to finish my book collection. You'd know that's quite an ambitious goal if you saw my collection. I stopped to think about it and the obvious plan of action was creating a plan of which books I would read, the order in which I would read them, and how much I would read per day. 

I combined these both aspirations (learning Java and reading more) and this is what came of it.
